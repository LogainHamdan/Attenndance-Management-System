1. department:

- Functional dependencies: None
- Since there are no functional dependencies, it trivially satisfies the first condition. The primary key (dept_name) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, department is in BCNF.

2. course:

- Functional dependencies: dept_name → course_name, dept_name → credits
- It satisfies the first condition. The primary key (course_id) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, course is in BCNF.

3. instructor:

- Functional dependencies: dept_name → name, dept_name → salary
- It satisfies the first condition. The primary key (ID) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, instructor is in BCNF.

3. time_slot:

- Functional dependencies: None
- It trivially satisfies the first condition. The primary key (time_slot_id, day, start_hr, start_min) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, time_slot is in BCNF.

4. lectures:

- Functional dependencies: course_id → lect_id
- it satisfies the first condition. The primary key (lect_id) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, lectures is in BCNF.
sections:

Functional dependencies: None
Since there are no functional dependencies, it trivially satisfies the first condition. The primary key (course_id, sec_id, semester, year) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, sections is in BCNF.

5. teaches:

- Functional dependencies: None
- it trivially satisfies the first condition. The primary key (teaches_id, course_id, sec_id, semester, year) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, teaches is in BCNF.

6. student:

- Functional dependencies: None
- it trivially satisfies the first condition. The primary key (student_id) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, student is in BCNF.

6. takes:

- Functional dependencies: None
- it trivially satisfies the first condition. The primary key (takes_id, course_id, sec_id, semester, year) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, takes is in BCNF.

7. users:

- Functional dependencies: None
- it trivially satisfies the first condition. The primary key (user_id) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, users is in BCNF.

8. attendance:

- Functional dependencies: None
- it trivially satisfies the first condition. The primary key (record_id) is a superkey for this relation, satisfying the second condition. Therefore, attendance is in BCNF.
